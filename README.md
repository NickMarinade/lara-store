# Lara Store

### Lara Store is a Laravel project that allows users to store and share interesting content such as films, series, books, anime, and more. Users can register, create a profile, and upload their own content. Only logged-in users can modify their own content. All data is stored on the backend using a SQL database.

# Features

* Routing system for easy navigation within the app
* Login system and user management to handle user authentication and registration
* Rights management to control user permissions and access levels
* Best practices for PHP, following the PSR12 coding standards for readable and maintainable code
* Well-written git history to track changes and collaborate effectively
* Model-View-Controller (MVC)-like structure for organized code separation
* CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) flow for managing content
* Implementation of different types of relationships for models using Eloquent Relations in Laravel
* Use of the Tailwind CSS framework for responsive and modern styling
* Integration of different packages, such as Alpine.js, to enhance the functionality and user experience of the app

# Backend

### For the backend, the app utilizes a mock API to simulate server-side functionality. This ensures that the data is stored on the backend rather than in local storage or session. The mock API provides a realistic environment for testing and development.
